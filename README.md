##Pre-Lab

###Useful Information
To-do
###Sensor Test
-Maybe add video ofsensor test. Will test using cell phone camera. Digital cameras pick up light in the infa red spectrum. It shows up as purple
-What are good reference values?? To-do/to-understand
###Setup of ADC10
-what registers
-which bits in registers are important
-whats the init sequence
###Hardware Setup
-which ADC10 channels will be used?
-which pins correspond to those channels?
###Code Ideas
-block or use interrupts?
-convert one sensor at a time or multiple?
